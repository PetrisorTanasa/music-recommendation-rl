# Music Recommendation Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Welcome to the Music Recommendation Reinforcement Learning Algorithms repository! This project showcases the implementation of two distinct Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, namely Q-learning and Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN). The work presented here was undertaken as part of a project at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Bucharest.

## Overview

In this repository, we leverage RL techniques to enhance the music recommendation process. The algorithms are applied to a dataset obtained from the Deezer API, which has been conveniently formatted into a CSV file included in this repository. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we have focused on five specific music categories to provide a proof of concept for our RL agents and illustrate their capabilities.
